# arduino-bomb-game
This is a simple Arduino based game about defusing a bomb. 

It was created due to a challenge that I couldn't make a game with one LED and two buttons. I did it and it was fun! However, I did add three more green LEDs to the game to make it more thrilling, but they are optional.

The goal of the game is to defuse the bomb. First the game chooses a random number and the guessed number is started at 0. The distance between 0 and the bomb number determines the speed (faster is closer). Use the two buttons to try to guess the number. If you win, the red led with go dark. If you lose, the red led will go steady on. You have three button presses before the bomb goes off.

Good Luck!
