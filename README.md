# arduino-bomb-game
A simple game and wiring to create a game about defusing a bomb.

The goal of the game is to defuse the bomb. First the game chooses a random number and the guessed number is started at 0. The distance between 0 and the bomb number determines the speed (faster is closer). Use the two buttons to try to guess the number. If you win, the red led with go dark. If you lose, the red led will go steady on. You have three button presses before the bomb goes off.

Good Luck!
